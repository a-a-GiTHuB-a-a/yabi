# yabi

Yet Another Brainfuck Interpreter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgaz/yabi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgaz/yabi)

The code is simple and doesn't use any advanced features or libraries.
Just plain recursion. It also doesn't use optimizations or
intermediate representations of Brainfuck code.
